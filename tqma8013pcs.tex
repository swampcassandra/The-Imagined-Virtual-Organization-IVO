\\\noindent In a perhaps strange to the reader form, the Tufte Handout, a LaTeX typesetting document, prepared in a on-line resource (Overleaf.com) introduces the idea of an Imagined Virtual Organization. This form permits marginal notes or figures or links that allow both expanding on text and not interrupting by forcing the reader to a footnote.\\ The modular construction of sections might permit the content to be presented in multiple ways, a book chapter, a blog entry, an online .pdf that can be read with Adobe Reader, including live links to full length articles or references and abstracts. Samples are included here to show possibilities. \\ Academic publishing is currently under the control of a few cartels, Springer, Elsevier, Thompson-Reuters and others. Single articles are extremely expensive. Open source rebellion is occurring around the edges with direct publication to the internet especially in some areas, astronomy, physics, genetics, etc where junior researchers are held back by publishing delay only to get 'scooped'. We live in interesting times.
